# MERN Stack Development Course - Coder Army

Welcome to my personal learning repository for the **MERN Stack Development course** offered by Rohit Negi @coderarmy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pcikNlDB-4&list=PLQEaRBV9gAFsistSzOgnD4cWgFGRVda4X). 
This repository serves as a daily journal and project archive, documenting my progress and storing all the code I write throughout the course.

## ðŸ“œ About This Repository

This project is my hands-on approach to mastering the MERN stack. Each folder or branch will correspond to a specific module or project from the course, containing notes, exercises, and mini-projects.

The goal is to:
* Track my daily progress and commits.
* Create a portfolio of projects built during the course.
* Serve as a personal reference for future development work.
* Demonstrate my skills in the technologies learned.
